## How it works


whenver you work on a project, you pip install all the dependencies

you never know their exact version


in this project, you need to just maintain the requirements file, that contains only the name of the dependencies (not the version)

It will you that requirements.txt file and then check their version in the virtual environment and it will create a new requirements.txt file that contians the name of the dependencies along with their versions
